        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Born in Penang, Malaysia on March 28, 2000, I am the first child in my extended family to live and grow up as
            an Asian-American (specifically Chinese-Malaysian-American).
            I first moved to San Jose, CA in June of 2000 and then to Sunnyvale, CA in September of 2004. Despite the
            lack of family in the United States,
            I have made countless friends and discovered passions of my own,
            including gaming, swimming, vlogging, and solving escape rooms. I am still very proud of my Southeast Asian
            heritage even though I live as an American,
            and I continue to celebrate the many holidays that I would have otherwise celebrated had I still lived in
            Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            While growing up in the United States, I learned English and Chinese around the same time in preschool.
            However, once
            I started elementary school, I was primarily taught English as part of my public education. Thus, I attended
            a private
            after-school program in Mountain View, CA to further hone my knowledge of Chinese language and culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also attended Homestead High School, where I learned Spanish as a third language. I was an avid member of the
            Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) as well as a varsity swimmer all four years of high school. During
            this time, I learned practical business values through attending FBLA Leadership Conferences and 
            even earned awards at the state and national levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. It was a last minute decision as I believed that graduating early in December 2021
            as opposed to June 2022 would allow me to take a step back on life and allow me to explore different opportunities.
            My coursework and other projects have led me down the path of web development, which I 
            enjoy the most. I was an officer at Slug Gaming over the last 3 years and was more recently the Banquet Coordinator for the Chinese Student Association (CSA).
            This year, I have been acting as the Co-Chair of CSA, overlooking all operations of the club in addition to helping
            acclimate new students to college life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope this brief summary of my life helped you get to know me a bit better, if you want to know how I can be beneficial to your
            company and/or brand, please feel free to reach out to me at <a style="color:white" href="mailto:raylee@ucsc.edu" ><i><u>raylee@ucsc.edu</u></i></a> for further questions or a resume.
