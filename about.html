        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>Born in Penang, Malaysia on March 28, 2000, I am the first child in my extended family to live and grow up as an Asian-American (specifically Chinese-Malaysian-American). 
            I first moved to San Jose, CA in June of 2000 and then to Sunnyvale, CA in September of 2004. Despite the lack of family in the United States,
            I have made countless friends and discovered passions of my own,
            including gaming, swimming, vlogging, and solving escape rooms. I am still very proud of my Southeast Asian heritage even though I live as an American, 
            and I continue to celebrate the many holidays that I would have otherwise celebrated had I still lived in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            While growing up in the United States, I learned English and Chinese around the same time in preschool. However, once
            I started elementary school, I was primarily taught English as part of my public education. Thus, I attended a private
            after-school program in Mountain View, CA to further hone my knowledge of Chinese language and culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            I attended Homestead High School, one of the five high schools in the prestigious Fremont Union High School District. I was an avid member of the
            Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) as well as a varsity swimmer all four years of high school. During this time, I also learned Spanish as a third language for four years,
            and while I can understand most conversations, I would say that my speaking skills could use some polishing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently attend the University of California, Santa Cruz and am heading into my final quarter as a Computer Science Major. I have been an officer at Slug Gaming over the last 3 years
            and was most recently the Banquet Coordinator for the Chinese Student Association (CSA). This year, I will be acting as the Co-Chair of CSA and overlooking all operations of the club, in addition to helping 
            acclimate new students to college life.
        </p>
