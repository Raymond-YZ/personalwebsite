        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Born in Penang, Malaysia on March 28, 2000, I am the first child in my extended family to live and grow up as
            an Asian-American (specifically Chinese-Malaysian-American).
            I first moved to San Jose, CA in June of 2000 and then to Sunnyvale, CA in September of 2004. Despite the
            lack of family in the United States,
            I have made countless friends and discovered passions of my own,
            including gaming, swimming, vlogging, and solving escape rooms. I am still very proud of my Southeast Asian
            heritage even though I live as an American,
            and I continue to celebrate the many holidays that I would have otherwise celebrated had I still lived in
            Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
            While growing up in the United States, I learned English and Chinese around the same time in preschool.
            However, once
            I started elementary school, I was primarily taught English as part of my public education. Thus, I attended
            a private
            after-school program in Mountain View, CA to further hone my knowledge of Chinese language and culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also attended Homestead High School, one of the five high schools in the prestigious Fremont Union High
            School District. I was an avid member of the
            Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) as well as a varsity swimmer all four years of high school. During
            this time, I also learned Spanish as a third language for four years,
            and while I can understand most conversations, I would say that my speaking skills could use some polishing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently attend the University of California, Santa Cruz and am heading into my final quarter as a
            Computer Science Major. I have been an officer at Slug Gaming over the last 3 years
            and was most recently the Banquet Coordinator for the Chinese Student Association (CSA). This year, I will
            be acting as the Co-Chair of CSA and overlooking all operations of the club, in addition to helping
            acclimate new students to college life.
        </p>
